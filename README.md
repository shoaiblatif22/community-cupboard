# community-cupboard-project


This project aims to create an online food bank app/website, addressing the issue of food distruibution and helping those in need.
 Through our contact us portal, anyone can volunteer to deliver our packages, becoming a Community Cupboard Volunteer, a caring community member dedicated to helping to those who need it most.
 Our website allows for users to choose from a wide range of packages catering to a variety of customers, whilst also considering those with dietary requirements such as allergies and intolerances as well as vegans.
 We hope to create an inclusive community for people to use foodbanks.
